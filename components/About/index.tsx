          Almost 40% of public school students don¬¥t have a access to internet
          at home, according to a study of 2020, even after the pandemics and
          distance learning.
          <br />
          <br />
          We believe in part of our goal is to democratize information so that
          more and more people can learn and study using the web.
          <br />
          <br />A percentage of your buy is reverted to existing social projects
          as well as some of our own projects, like donating computers and
          cellphones for those in need!
